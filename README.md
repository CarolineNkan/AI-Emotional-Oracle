### 💡 Concept  
The Emotional Oracle is an AI fortune teller that reads your emojis as emotional frequencies and predicts the future through poetic data.  
Each emoji unlocks a different Oracle personality — Flirty, Goth, Zen, Glitch, or Party — with its own tone, fortune style, and mood reflection.

### 🧩 Example Reading  
**User Input:** 😈🎉🪩🍾  

**Oracle Output:**

>
> ⚡ Emotional Voltage: High  
> 💧 Element: Fire  
> 🎭 Mood Aura: "Midnight Confetti Rebellion"  
>
> 🎟️ Fortune Ticket #418 — *The Champagne Storm*  
> 💫 *“The spotlight loves you… but so do the echoes.”*  
> 💾 Prediction confidence: 92% | Emotional Calibration: Fire  
>
> 🍸 *Advice:* Don’t just ride the chaos — conduct it.  
>
> *“I will remember this feeling next time, traveler.”*
